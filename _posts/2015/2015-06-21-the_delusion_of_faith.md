For many people, belief in God is a delusion. In the introduction of _The God Delusion_, Richard Dawkins describes it as exactly that, quoting Robert Pirsig who said “When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called Religion.” (Richard Dawkins, _The God Delusion_, p4) Of course, any false belief can be called a _delusion_, the deciding question is whether or not the belief is false. Sceptics rightly point out that the claim that God exists is just as subject to the burden of proof as any other claim, and that when believers try to avoid or dodge the burden of proof, they are demonstrating the weakness of their position. But there is also debate about whether sceptics and unbelievers share a similar burden of proof, or whether their position wins by default.

Some people draw a Cartesian plane with belief on one axis, and knowledge on the other. The idea is that whether you’re a theist or an atheist is a matter of belief (the horizontal axis); and whether you’re Gnostic or agnostic, is a matter of knowledge (the vertical axis). When belief and knowledge are separated like this, it often produces the following Cartesian plane of possible positions about God’s existence.

However, in order to draw this Cartesian plane, belief and knowledge must be viewed as mutually independent. In order to move along one axis without moving along the other, the variables that the axes represent must be mutually independent variables. But it is difficult to see how knowledge is mutually independent from belief. Indeed, many define knowledge as _justified true belief_, or at least some sort of sub-set of belief. While you can certainly believe things that you don’t know for sure, it is impossible to know something that something is true if you don’t actually believe that it is true. This relationship is sometimes illustrated with the following diagram.

The relationship between knowledge and belief makes the Cartesian plane above difficult to maintain, because Cartesian planes require two mutually independent variables. However, the two parallel spectrums may be joined at the bottom (impartial agnostic), and flattened out to produce a single spectrum from strong atheist to strong theist with impartial agnostic in the middle. This is precisely the spectrum of positions that Richard Dawkins lays out in _The God Delusion_, and it’s not only epistemologically sound, but it’s a very helpful spectrum to use to navigate the various positions that people hold.

The philosophical burden of proof applies to all claims, not just claims about the existence of x, but also claims about the non-existence of x. If someone says “I think God exists”, someone else can ask “What do you base that on?” and put them under the burden of proof. Similarly, if someone says “I don’t think God exists”, someone else can ask “What do you base that on?” and put them under the exact same burden of proof. The only one who legitimately escapes the burden of proof, is the person who says “I don’t know.” When someone says “I don’t know”, the question “What do you base that on?” simply doesn’t apply. Atheists rightly point out the epistemological special pleading of believers who try to avoid or dodge the burden of proof for their claims, but if/when they go on to make claims about the non-existence of God (with any degree of certainty), they too have a burden of proof to bear. Arguing that the burden of proof doesn’t apply to the particular claim that you’re making, whether it’s the positive claim that God exists, or the negative claim that God doesn’t exist (or that God probably doesn’t exist), is also special pleading about the burden of proof.

This is a significant problem for atheists, because it means that all of their arguments against belief in general, can be turned on their belief that there is no God. At this point, many atheists insist that atheism is not the belief that there is no God, but rather the lack of a belief in God. They would like to draw the line on Dawkins’ spectrum to include agnosticism on their side (often arguing that agnosticism is under the umbrella of atheism) so that they share the shelter from the burden of proof that agnosticism enjoys. However, there is a significant difference between a negative belief (a belief that something doesn’t exist), and the absence of all beliefs. If Dawkins’ spectrum is transposed so that strong atheist is -3, strong theist is 3, and impartial agnostic is 0; then the insistence on the confusion between atheism and agnosticism, is like refusing to call a negative number a negative number, and only recognising positive numbers and non-positive numbers (zero is a non-positive number, but not a negative number). Theists have a positive belief about God’s existence (to varying degrees), atheists have a negative belief about God’s existence (again, to varying degrees), but the only one who has zero beliefs about God’s existence is the agnostic. If religions were TV channels, atheism would not be off, agnosticism would be. Atheism would be set to The Atheist Experience, The Unbelievers, and various YouTube channels promoted by atheist groups.

Some argue that the view that there is no God is the default view, just as the view that there are no celestial teapots or flying spaghetti monsters in our solar system is the default view. However, there are significant problems with these comparisons. We know a lot about celestial objects and about teapots; and we know a lot about flying objects, about spaghetti, and about monsters. But if there is a God, the only way we could ever know something about him is if he revealed himself to us. Comparing the existence of God to the existence of impossible entities, may disprove a number of imaginary gods, but it’s not really an argument against theism. It’s an argument against a specific type of theism that no one actually holds. Others suggest that atheism or even naturalism are ‘innocent until proven guilty’, like the guilt of the accused in a trial, but this analogy has significant issues as well. In a court of law, the accused are treated by the state as innocent until proven guilty, but if a member of the jury goes into the courtroom with a verdict of ‘not guilty’ before the trial, they are recused (disqualified) from the trial. Their decision, for or against, has to be made based on the evidence during the trial, not on a position they had before the trial which remains unmoved.

A number of atheists argue that agnostics should be included under the umbrella of atheism because there is no functional difference between atheists and agnostics. Of course, this may be true for a number of agnostics, but it’s certainly not true for all agnostics, and the proposition that there is no functional difference can be disproved by counter examples. A number of people who identify as ‘agnostic’ also describe themselves as ‘seeking’, and exhibit a functional difference in their worldview and ethical framework. Moreover, some agnostics even adamantly refuse to be counted as atheists. Mike Dobbins is one such agnostic, who has written a book called _The Case Against Atheism_, in which he writes:

> “When an atheist says “I don’t believe in God”, indicating a disbelief in God, they have a negative belief. A negative belief is still a belief, and a belief not supported by evidence to create knowledge is a belief based on faith. If the atheist simply had an absence of belief in it wouldn’t be a belief. Absence of belief is no belief. Absence is something that isn’t there. The reality is, most atheists go beyond absence of belief to disbelieving in God or positively believing there isn’t a God. Once they’ve crossed this line, their belief becomes a faith. This is perfectly fine and simply adds to the world’s assortment of faiths, but it is difficult for atheists to acknowledge let alone embrace. Something about the word ‘faith’, for some reason, seems to scare them. From my experience reading atheist literature, debating atheists online, and actively listening to what atheists say, it is abundantly clear that most atheists want to have their cake and eat it too. They talk and debate like people who believe there is no God, literally saying ‘God doesn’t exist” or ‘There is no God”, but once you point out this is merely another faith, they rush to their dictionary and loudly proclaim ‘atheism is the absence of belief!’ Agnostics and theists alike are not amused by the hypocrisy and deceit. We know that 2 + 2 = 4, even when an atheist calls it 5. If today’s atheism continues to proclaim there is no God, without any evidence to support the belief as knowledge, then that atheism is based on faith. Theists and agnostics have every right and are correct when they label it as such. Modern atheists who try to embrace classical atheism long after they’ve abandoned the ship are in denial of their own beliefs. A long hard look in the mirror is long overdue. I know many atheists recoil at the sound of the word ‘faith’ but it’s time to face the facts. If you believe there isn’t a God you’re atheism is based on faith. It’s high time these atheists accept who they are and stop trying to sail both ships. We can see the classical atheism ship, and you’re not on it.” (Mike Dobbins, _The Case Against Atheism_, p30-31)

A false belief can indeed be a delusion, and that’s why it’s important that our beliefs be rationally justified. Avoiding the burden of proof is never a good sign for our beliefs, it’s often an indication that there is a lack of rational justification for them, as well as an unwillingness to let them go when faced with it. Sceptics rightly point out the problem with holding beliefs without evidence or rational justification, but their own belief about God’s existence isn’t somehow immune. The persistent confusion between atheism and agnosticism in order to avoid of the burden of proof, is strong evidence for precisely the problem that is rightly being pointed out.
