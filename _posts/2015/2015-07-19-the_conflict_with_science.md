Many people (especially in the west) perceive a tension or even a conflict between science and belief in God. How can modern, educated and scientific people possibly believe in a God who spoke the universe into existence and performs miracles, but only revealed himself in pre-scientific times? Strong proponents of atheism even suggest that there is a zero-sum game between science and religion, that is, the more scientific people are the less religious they are, and the more religious people are the less scientific they are. Indeed, there are many religious people who see science as something to be distrusted and resisted, but is there an inherent conflict between science and belief in God?
 
It all depends on how you define both _God_ and _Science_. There are very few theists who believe in a god of the scientific gaps, and even fewer scientists who define science so broadly that it could include the discipline of theology. Indeed, according to the National Academy of Science: “Science is a way of knowing about the natural world. It is limited to explaining the natural world through natural causes. Science can say nothing about the supernatural. Whether God exists or not, is a question about which science is neutral.”
 
A growing number of people now see science and belief in God as complementary. Just as Henry Ford and the Ford production line provide complementary explanations of the existence of the Ford Galaxy (explanations of agency and mechanism respectively), so too God and science are seen by many to provide complementary explanations of our galaxy and everything in it. Both are needed for a complete picture. They are not in competition at all, let alone a zero-sum game (a perfect tug of war). Science has become exceedingly good at answering the _how_ questions of life the universe and everything, but not the question of _why_. John Dickson illustrates this well with the following analogy:
 
> A young boy walks into the kitchen one morning to find a kettle boiling on the stove. Wondering why it is boiling, he asks his dad (who just happens to be a scientist). His dad promptly replies, “Well son it’s because the combustion of the gas transfers heat to the water. The molecules of the water become more and more agitated, give off steam and there is your boiling.” A little dissatisfied by his father’s reply, the kid asks his mum the same question, “Mum, why is the kettle boiling?” Finally, he gets the answer he has been looking for: “The kettle’s boiling because I’m about to make us all a cup of coffee.” The father explained how the kettle was boiling. The mum answered why. Similarly, science is great about speculating about the big how of the universe, but we must turn elsewhere to find out why... The bout between science and God is called off due to the fact that the competitors were competing for different titles. (John Dickson, _A Sneaking Suspicion_, p50-51)
 
This does not necessarily mean that science and belief in God are non-overlapping magistria (NOMA). Most religions do indeed make claims that could, at least in theory, be scientifically falsified. An example that’s often brought up the perceived tension between the biblical account of creation and the scientific account of evolution. While the Bible certainly claims that God created all life on earth, it does not specify the supernaturalness of every step of creation. Genesis 1 offers an explanation of agancy, but not necessarily a explanation of mechanism. It focuses on the _who_ and the _why_ of creation, but it is not meant to be read as a scientific account of _how_ God created everything. As one commentator puts it:
 
> If ‘evolution’ is elevated to the status of a worldview of the way things are, then there is a direct conflict with biblical faith. But if ‘evolution’ remains at the level of scientific biological hypothesis, it would seem that there is little reason for conflict between the implications of Christian belief in the creator and the scientific explorations of the way which – at the level of biology – God has gone about his creating process. (David Atkinson, _The Message of Genesis 1-11_, p31)
 
Genesis 1 and modern science both attest to the universe having a beginning, and beginning as a primordial ‘blob’, which is now formed and filled. While science speaks of the expansion of the universe, the Bible describes it as the Lord stretching out the heavens. As an unbeliever, Dr. Andrew Parker wrote a scientific account of the Cambrian explosion: _In the Blink of an Eye_, only to discover “a whole series of parallels between Genesis 1 and the modern, scientific account of life’s history” (Andrew Parker, _The Genesis Enigma_, xii). He has subsequently written on the striking parallels between the account in Genesis and the scientific history of the earth in _The Genesis Enigma: Why the Bible is Scientifically Accurate_.  This is precisely what we would expect if we assume a coherence between God’s general revelation (studied in science) and his special revelation (studied in theology). We can quite properly talk about a history of creation, the account of creation is the account of a history in temporal sequence. When the scientific account of the beginnings of the universe is compared to Genesis 1, we see so many parallels that a natural synthesis is almost hard to avoid.

For many, the various claims of miracles made in the Bible seem to be profoundly at odds with science. It’s almost as if you have to allow for the possibility of miracles when you go to church, but deny them when you go into the lab. Indeed, when you go into the lab, you have to make an assumption about the regularity of nature – that your experiment will be repeatable in another lab – but this is not in conflict with belief in God. People who believe in God in general, and Christians in particular, really do believe in the regularity of nature. One of the burdens of Genesis 1 is to show us how orderly God was in creating the universe. The assumption of the regularity of nature is sometimes called methodological naturalism. No one actually denies this, but often the leap is made from methodological naturalism (the view that miracles are miraculous), to philosophical naturalism (the view that miracles are impossible). However, philosophical naturalism simply does not follow from the regularity of nature (or methodological naturalism). Indeed, without the regularity of nature, we would have no way of recognising as miracle as a miracle. Belief in God doesn’t deny the regularity of nature (which is required for science), but rather, belief in God depends on it. As C.S. Lewis wrote:
 
> If this week I put a thousand pounds in the drawer of my desk, add two thousand next week and another thousand the week thereafter, the laws of arithmetic allow me to predict that the next time I come to my drawer, I shall find four thousand pounds. But suppose when I next open the drawer, I find only one thousand pounds, what shall I conclude? That the laws of arithmetic have been broken? Certainly not! I might more reasonably conclude that some thief has broken the laws of the State and stolen three thousand pounds out of my drawer. One thing it would be ludicrous to claim is that the laws of arithmetic make it impossible to believe in the existence of such a thief or the possibility of his intervention. On the contrary, it is the normal workings of those laws that have exposed the existence and activity of the thief. (C.S. Lewis, _Miracles_, p62)
 
One piece of evidence that atheists often bring up to support their case, is that there is a disproportionately large number of atheists studying, teaching and working in the field of science. This is indeed true; the percentage of scientists who identify as atheists is higher than the percentage of the general population who identify as atheists. But correlation does not necessarily imply causation. If there are a disproportionately large number of atheists in science, then there has to be a disproportionately large number of believers in other fields. As it turns out, atheists are statistically more likely to study science, while Christians are more likely to study (and teach) education and nursing ([http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons](http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf)). Given the teachings of Christianity and naturalism, this is very much to be expected. If/when the gospel moves people to look after the young and the sick, we would expect more Christians to study education and nursing. If/when people are convinced that the natural world is all that there is, we would expect them to study the natural world in the natural sciences. For a naturalist, science really is _The Greatest Show on Earth_.
 
Philosophical naturalism is perfectly consistent with methodological naturalism and the scientific method, but it is not a logical conclusion from them. There is no _one_ scientific worldview. People of all different types of worldviews can and do, study, teach and work in the natural sciences. As Neil DeGrasse Tyson points out, this is not a religious opinion, it is an empirical fact:
 
> Most religious people in America fully embrace science, and so the argument that religion has some issue with science applies to a small fraction of those who declare that they’re religious. They just happen to be a very vocal fraction, and so you get the impression that there’s more of them than there actually is. It’s actually the minority of religious people who reject science or feel threatened by it or want to restrict where science can go. There rest are just fine with science, and it has been that way since the beginning... Consider also, that in America 40% of American scientists are religious. So this notion that if you’re a scientist you’re an atheist, or that if you’re religious you’re not a scientist, that’s just empirically false. It’s an empirically false statement. (Neil DeGrasse Tyson [Science and Faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbvDYyoAv9k))
 
Moreover, many historians of science see a causal link between the rediscovery of true Christianity in the European Reformation, and the birth of modern science. In the early 16th century, the Bible’s teaching of salvation by grace alone was rediscovered by Martin Luther, and this had an enormous impact (some say, an immeasurable impact) on European thought. The facts of history are: that the Christian Reformation took place in Europe in the early 16th century, the birth of modern science took place in Europe in the 16th and 17th century, and the Enlightenment took place in Europe in the 17th and 18th century. Of course, history is very complicated and there are many other contributing factors, but few historians would explain this chain of events as ‘coincidence’. Many hold to some form of [Merton’s Thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton_Thesis), that the popularity of science in England in the 17th century, and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values. This has also been famously expressed by C.S. Lewis as 

> Men became scientific because they expected Law in Nature, and they expected Law in Nature because they believed in a Lawgiver. (C.S. Lewis, _Miracles_, p110)
 
There is a saying “if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything.” Of course, this is not a universal rule that applies to all people, but a person’s worldview (and their commitment to it) plays a very big role in how they interpret new and strange ideas. When a growing number of people lose their religion, but maintain an awareness of the ‘spiritual’, they’re often be more likely to believe in ‘spiritual’ guides, palm readers, horoscopes and other superstitions. A few years ago the Wall St Journal published an article citing an empirical study that indicated that it was actually when people turned away from Christianity, that they became more susceptible to superstitions.
 
> A comprehensive new study released by Baylor University, shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology. It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations, far from being resistant to superstition, tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians.
