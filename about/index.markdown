We're a bunch of people who gather together in Melbourne as an Evangelical Church.

As Evangelicals, we emphasise the teaching of the Bible, the cross of Christ, the need for lives to be changed, and expressing the gospel in our lives.

Our purpose is to proclaim Jesus, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ (Colossians 1:28).  


## Why are city churches important?

In Rodney Stark’s book The Rise of Christianity, Stark notes: 

> “To cities filled with the homeless and impoverished, Christianity offered charity as well as hope. To cities filled with newcomers and strangers, Christianity offered an immediate basis for attachments. To cities filled with orphans and widows, Christianity provided a new and expanded sense of family. To cities torn by violent ethnic strife, Christianity offered a new basis for social solidarity.” 

We’d love to be a church like this for the city of Melbourne, but we need your help.

## What to Expect
We meet each Sunday from 5pm until about 6pm. We sing together, pray, hear from the Bible, and hear the word proclaimed. We also have a time for questions after each sermon. We have a kids church during the sermon and Q&A. On the first Sunday of the month we also have dinner together after church. We don’t have a dress code so just come as you are. On a Sunday afternoon, there’s generally parking available in the surrounding streets.

The church is not a museum of saints, but a hospital for sinners. Whatever your past, whatever your background, we’d love to welcome you without judging you. We welcome sceptics, believers, and everyone in between. Socks are optional, but grace is required. Forgiveness is offered, hope is alive, and love is for one another is always encouraged.
