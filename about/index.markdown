We're a bunch of people who gather together in Melbourne as an Evangelical Church.

As Evangelicals, we emphasise the teaching of the Bible, the cross of Christ, the need for lives to be changed, and expressing the gospel in our lives.

Our purpose is to proclaim Jesus, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ (Colossians 1:28).
