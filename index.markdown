## City Bible Forum, Life at Work Conference – Witness: Word and Deed
_6pm-9pm, Wednesday Oct 28 and Thursday Oct 29, 263 William Street_
The Gospel is good news. So why is no one interested? Why is it so hard to share my faith? Join us at this year’s Life@Work annual conference as we explore an approach to your witness that is realistic, holistic and exciting.

## National Training Event 2015 – December 5-9
_Extra-ordinary mission - Engaging with the Supernatural_
Our battle isn’t against flesh and blood but against spiritual power and forces. But in our day it’s easy to miss this. What does it mean to be in this battle? How do we get involved? How do we make a real difference? This is what we’ll be tackling at NTE15. Transport and accommodation is organised by your local Christian Union. More information and registration at [www.nte.org.au](www.nte.org.au)
