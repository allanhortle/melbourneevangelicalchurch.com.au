## Public Forum – Does it Satisfy?
_Friday March 20, 12:30pm. 282 Exhibition St_

Which experience of life is most satisfying? Atheism or Christianity? Hear the stories of two men who have experienced both. Matt Dillahunty once studied at theological seminary to bolster his faith, but he lost it, became an atheist and is now the host of the TV show ‘The Atheist Experience.’ Shane Rogerson was once a Marxist atheist, but was converted to Christianity and is now the pastor of an evangelical church in Prahran in Melbourne. Hear their stories. Ask your questions. Be challenged to work out which experience of life is most satisfying.

## Entrust Women: Love Unlimited
_May 9th, Holy Trinity Doncaster_

​​"We’re a group of women from different churches in Melbourne with a dream: To offer great Bible teaching by women and for women in Melbourne. 

We’ve talked with other women, and they tell us this is what they want. It’s what they hunger for. Not just fluff, but good, solid, substantial encouragement from God’s word.

Last year, a group of us got together and started talking about this dream. We came up with an idea: an annual, day-long conference, where women from different churches across Melbourne can get together to encourage each other, hear great Bible teaching by other women, and get training in how to help women know and grow in Jesus. And so Entrust Women was born."
