## Public Forum – Does it Satisfy?
_Friday March 20, 12:30pm. 282 Exhibition St_
Which experience of life is most satisfying? Atheism or Christianity? Hear the stories of two men who have experienced both. Matt Dillahunty once studied at theological seminary to bolster his faith, but he lost it, became an atheist and is now the host of the TV show ‘The Atheist Experience.’ Shane Rogerson was once a Marxist atheist, but was converted to Christianity and is now the pastor of an evangelical church in Prahran in Melbourne. Hear their stories. Ask your questions. Be challenged to work out which experience of life is most satisfying.
