title:  "What We Believe"
---

At City Unichurch, we believe in:  

1. The divine inspiration and trustworthiness of Holy Scripture as originally given, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
2. The unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the Godhead.
3. The sovereign work of God in creation, revelation, redemption, judgment and establishing His kingdom.
4. The creation of men and women together in the image of God and together having dominion over the created order.
5. The universal sinfulness and guilt of humanity since the fall, rendering all people subject to God's wrath and condemnation, and unable to turn themselves to God without the prior regenerating work of God's Spirit, who convicts the world of sin, righteousness and judgment.
6. The conception of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit, and his birth of the virgin Mary. He is both God and sinless man.
7. Redemption from the guilt, penalty and power of sin, only through the sacrificial death, as our representative and substitute, of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God, demonstrating God's love to us most perfectly and his victory over Satan and his forces.
8. The physical resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead in flesh, bones and body.
9. The necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit to make the death of Christ effective in individual sinners, granting them repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, so that salvation is entirely of God's grace and not of their merit or good works.
10. The indwelling and baptising of all believers in, by and with the Holy Spirit, illuminating their minds to grasp the truth of Scripture, producing in them his fruit, granting to them his gifts, and empowering them for service.
	* The ministry as belonging to the whole congregation, each member being encouraged and trained to develop and implement God-given gifts for service to others and not for self-indulgence.
	* The ministry of the Word of God, especially in the proclamation of the Cross, the Resurrection, sin and repentance, as of primary importance for the well being of the church.
	* Tongues, miracles and healings can be legitimate spiritual gifts, yet secondary to the ministry of the Word of God, and not usual or necessary signs either of salvation or Spirit filling.
11. The expectation of the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory to judge the living and the dead.
12. The church as the body of Christ called out from the world to be his people, united to himself and each other in love, commissioned to proclaim the Good News to all and to make them his disciples.
	* Men and women, both being created in the image of God, are equal in importance, significance and preciousness to God.
	* The roles of men and women are complementary rather than in competition, with men being called to sacrificially love their family and take responsibility for biblical teaching, including being the preachers within the church, and women called to compassionately love their family and serve alongside men within the church.
