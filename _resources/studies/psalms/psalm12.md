title: Experiencing God’s Truth in a World of Confusion
passage: Psalm 12
--- 

> **For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.**  
> 1 Help, LORD, for no one is faithful anymore;  
> those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.  
> 2 Everyone lies to their neighbour;  
> they flatter with their lips  
> but harbor deception in their hearts.  
> 3 May the LORD silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue –  
> 4 those who say,  
> “By our tongues we will prevail;  
> our own lips will defend us – who is lord over us?”  
> 5 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the LORD.  
> “I will protect them from those who malign them.”  
> 6 And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible,  
> like gold refined seven times.  
> 7 You, LORD, will keep the needy safe  
> and will protect us forever from the wicked,  
> 8 who freely strut about  
> when what is vile is honoured by the human race.  

1. Discuss: In a world of voices competing for our attention, who do you listen to/read? 
1. The psalmist writes that ‘no one is faithful anymore’ (v1), what do you think he means? 
1. Do you think people value being faithful & loyal? Is this something you see in the city? 
1. In what ways do people lie to their neighbours? How/why do we flatter with our lips? 
1. The last line of verse 2 is literally: ‘with two hearts they speak.’ Do you see this today?
1. Why would the psalmist long for the LORD to silence flattering lips / boastful tongues? 
1. Do you think people operate as: ‘by our tongues we will prevail... who is lord over us?’ 
1. What’s the danger in this kind of thinking? What do people do without a ‘lord over us’? 
1. What did this kind of thinking/speaking lead to then (v5)? Does this still happen today?
1. What’s the promise being made in verse 5? Can we trust this? Why does the psalmist? 
1. How does the psalmist describe ‘the words of the LORD’? How do you view the Bible? 
1. What would it look like today to really believe that the words of the LORD are flawless? 
1. List some implications of the contrast between human lips and the words of the LORD?
1. In what sense does the LORD keep the needy safe and protect us from the wicked (v7)? 
1. Should we also seek to look after the needy? Why? What steps can we take to do this? 
1. What’s the alternative? How is it described in the psalm (v8)? Does this happen today? 
1. How does this psalm begin and end? What is contrasted? What are the implications?
